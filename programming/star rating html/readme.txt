hi,
i am suraj of 1st year ice department( 110112087 ). i am basically interested in programming and embedded systems. i know
c,c++,java,python(not fully but i can manage if a program is given),javascript,css,html(learning only so i know only
 certain functions and prototype i m familiar with). i am planning on to improve my programming in these holidays. thats it.

about this program, i tried it with hover function also but it dint work satisfactorily because we cannot incorporate the
 idea of switch or loops in main css. in process of doing the "hover" way you will end up in typing a lot which is
 unnecessary. so i came back to the normal type. anyways i will attach the hover code also for you to check( it just does
 changing of image when the mouse is kept on it)


ps. checkout starunique.html (if u want to check what i did with hover) but this is not what you guys had asked for!!
